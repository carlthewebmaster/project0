        <h2>Instruments</h2>
        <p>In addition to my <a href="gear.html">music gear</a>, I also have a lot of instruments.
          Here's a list of some of my favorites:
        </p>

        <dl class="row">
          <dt class="col-sm-3">Drum Kit</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-9">I have a Roland TD-3 vDrum kit that I bought as a very used
            floor model from Guitar Center.  It has held up well.</dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-3">Keyboard</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-9">
            <p>I really like my Roland RD-300x keyboard.  It sounds great and has weighted (piano-like) keys.</p>
            <p>If I were to get another keyboard, it'd probably be a <a href="https://www.nordkeyboards.com/products/nord-electro-6">Nord Electro 6</a>, which has fantastic sounds and un-weighted (organ-like) keys.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-3">Bass Guitar</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-9">I bought my Yamaha bass from a friend for $70. Sounds ok but I always thought it wasn't very good.  Then I saw a pretty good jazz guy in a hotel bar playing the same one, so I guess I got a good deal.</dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-3">Guitars</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-9">
            <p>I have a lot of guitars.  Here are a few of them.</p>
            <dl class="row">
              <dt class="col-sm-4">Fender Telecaster '52 Reissue</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-8">I love the sound of this guitar.  It's all black with gold trim, and I got it by chance from a Guitar store in Colorado.  I had played one and liked it, and the first one that came up when I went looking online was the one I bought.</dd>
              <dt class="col-sm-4">Baby Taylor BT1</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-8">Small, light, and sounds fantastic.  Not only that, it's great for travel!</dd>
              <dt class="col-sm-4">Pignose Travel Electric with built-in amp.</dt>
              <dd class="col-sm-8">It's very orange but the amp overdrives very nicely. I wish it would stay in tune better.</dd>
